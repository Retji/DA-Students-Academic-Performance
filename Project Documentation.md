# Project Name:
> DA-Students-Academic-Performance

# Project Objective: 
> This project  was a done with a view to find potential trends from four sets of  using SQL joins to create a single reporting table called academic_info. The four data files are named county_info,student_academic_info,student_family_details, and student_personal_detail respectively.
----

# Data Sourcing:
> The dataset used for this project was obtained from entrylevel.net. 

----
# Data Transformation:
> The process of data cleaning and wrangling was carried with the use of SQL and Excel. Using MySQL workbench, a database was created and the four tables were then imported into the the database to create four separate tables. These four tables were joined to create a single table as well as other tables of interest that holds some potential insights. The tables were then exported as csv. Pivot tables were then created using the csv files exported.

# Findings and Recommendation: 
> The dataset shows that of the students'3,507 population, 1,916 passed and 1,591 failed based on years of study average of 50. There is a strong correlation between income levels of parents and student's performance as can be deduced that students from home whose income level is below the country average perfomed are the majority (735) among those who score below the 50 score point.
